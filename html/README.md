I've used
- w3's responsive header with some adjustments (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_header.asp)
- https://shenanigans.shoghisimon.ca/collection/css-blur-blob-bg/ with some adjustments
- GTNH icons, as this project is for monitoring GTNH.

I don't claim any copyright or licensing on these parts or modifications, as they are so minor value adjustments.
